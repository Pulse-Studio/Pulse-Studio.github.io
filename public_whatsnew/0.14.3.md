## Cave Exploration Just Got Much Better

### Three Types of Caves to Discover

**Tunnel Caves (Worm Caves)**
Long, winding passages that twist and turn underground. Perfect for resource gathering and creating underground bases. These are the most common type you'll find.

**Where to find:** Y=30-80 (best at medium depths)

**Chamber Caves (The Big Rooms)**
Massive underground halls with high ceilings. These rare caves are breathtaking when you stumble upon them. Great for building underground cities!

**Where to find:** Y=40-70 (rare but spectacular)

**Network Caves (The Maze)**
Complex interconnected systems with multiple paths crossing each other. These create natural labyrinths - don't get lost! Bring torches!

**Where to find:** Y=20-60 (challenging to navigate)

### No More Cut-Off Caves!

**Before:** Caves would suddenly end with a wall of stone when you crossed into a new area.

**Now:** Caves smoothly continue from one area to another, creating natural-feeling underground systems. You can follow a tunnel for hundreds of blocks!

### Better Cave Distribution

- **Deep underground (Y=5-20):** Few caves, mostly rock
- **Medium depths (Y=30-80):** LOTS of caves! Best for exploration
- **Higher up (Y=80-120):** Some caves, getting rarer
- **Surface level (Y=120+):** Almost no caves

**Tip:** Dig down to Y=50 for the best cave exploration experience!

## Forests Look (Almost :D) Perfect Now

### The Problem I Fixed

Remember seeing trees with half their leaves missing? Or random leaf blocks floating in weird places? That's all gone!

**What was happening:**
- Trees near area boundaries had their leaves cut off
- You'd see floating leaves in caves
- Leaves would appear far from any tree
- Forests looked unnatural and "blocky"

### The Solution

**Now all trees look complete!**

- Full, lush canopies on every tree
- No cut-off leaves at area boundaries
- No random floating leaves anywhere
- Forests look more natural and beautiful

**Best spots to notice the difference:**
- Walk through a dense forest
- Look for trees near coordinates like X=16, X=32, Z=16, Z=32
- Check underground - no more random leaves in caves!

## Mac Users Welcome!

Good news for Mac players! The game now officially supports macOS, including the new Apple Silicon (M chips).

**What this means:**
- Download and play on your Mac
- Full performance on both Intel and Apple Silicon
- Same great experience as Windows

## Performance

**Don't worry, your FPS is safe!**

- Game still runs at smooth 60 FPS
- World generation is slightly slower (you won't notice it)
- Memory usage is basically the same
- Overall experience is smoother and more polished

## Coming Soon

I'm already working on the next update! Here's a sneak peek:

- **Ore veins in caves** - Find resources on cave walls
- **Cave decorations** - Stalactites, stalagmites, underground lakes
- **Tree variety** - Different tree types and sizes
- **Performance improvements** - Even smoother gameplay
