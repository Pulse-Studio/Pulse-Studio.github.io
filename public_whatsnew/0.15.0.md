# What's New in Version 0.15.0

**Welcome, Explorer!** This update transforms the world with massive biome diversity improvements!

## The World Is Now 3-4x More Diverse!

Tired of endless plains and oceans? **Not anymore!**

**What changed:**
- 3 brand new biomes to explore
- Mountains are now TWICE as tall
- Deserts are 6x more common
- Every biome looks dramatically different

## New Biomes to Discover

### 🌲 Taiga - Cold Mountain Forests

**Where to find it:** Cold and humid regions (high altitude areas)

**What it looks like:**
- Rolling hills covered in dense forests
- Elevation: 70-110 blocks
- Temperature: Below freezing
- Perfect for mountain bases

**Build tip:** Great natural defense with hills and trees!

### 🌴 Savanna - African Plains with Acacia Trees

**Where to find it:** Warm and dry regions

**What it looks like:**
- Mostly sandy terrain (80%)
- Rare grass patches (20%)
- Unique curved acacia trees with flat tops
- Looks like African savanna!

**The coolest part:** Acacia trees!
- Trunks grow diagonally (curved!)
- Flat umbrella-shaped canopy on top
- Only grow on grass patches
- 4 different curve directions

**Build tip:** Great visibility for spotting mobs from far away!

### ❄️ Tundra - Frozen Rocky Plains

**Where to find it:** Extremely cold regions

**What it looks like:**
- Flat, desolate terrain
- Rocky surface
- Elevation: 55-70 blocks
- Coldest biome in the game

**Build tip:** Challenging survival location for hardcore players!

## Massively Improved Existing Biomes

### 🏔️ Mountains - Now EPIC!

**Before:** Small hills (up to 90 blocks)

**Now:** Towering peaks reaching 180+ blocks!

**What changed:**
- 2x taller (heightModifier 4.0!)
- More dramatic peaks
- Better as landmarks
- Challenging to climb

**Where you'll find them:** Cold regions (temperature below 0)

**Fun fact:** The difference between Ocean floor and Mountain peak is now **140 blocks!** (was only 27)

### 🏜️ Desert - Finally Common!

**Before:** Rare (only 2% of world)

**Now:** Common (12% of world) - **6x more frequent!**

**What changed:**
- Taller dunes (+3 blocks base height)
- More varied terrain
- Easier to find for sand collection

**Build tip:** Great for glass production with all that sand!

### 🌊 Ocean - Less Water, More Land

**Before:** 35% of the world (too much!)

**Now:** 12% of the world

**What this means:**
- Less time swimming
- More interesting terrain
- Oceans are now actual features, not the default

### 🌳 Forest - More Rolling Hills

**Before:** Mostly flat with trees

**Now:** Rolling hills with dense forests

**What changed:**
- heightModifier increased to 1.3
- Base height +3
- Creates natural valleys and hilltops

**Build tip:** Hills provide great views and natural architecture!

### 🌾 Plains - Still There, But Less Dominant

**Before:** 40% of the world (too much!)

**Now:** 25% of the world

**What this means:**
- Still common for easy building
- But world feels more varied
- Better terrain variation

## How Biomes Look Different Now

### Height Comparison

```
Mountains: 90-180+ blocks  🏔️🏔️🏔️🏔️
Forest:    65-100 blocks   🌲🌲🌲
Taiga:     70-110 blocks   🌲🌲🌲
Plains:    60-90 blocks    🌾🌾
Savanna:   65-85 blocks    🌴🌴
Desert:    65-85 blocks    🏜️🏜️
Tundra:    55-70 blocks    ❄️
Ocean:     20-50 blocks    🌊
```

**You can now easily identify biomes by elevation!**

## The Technical Magic

### Multi-Scale Climate System

**What is this?**

The game now uses two layers of randomness:
1. **Macro-scale** (large climate zones) - creates continents and regions
2. **Micro-scale** (local variations) - creates biome diversity

**Result:** Natural-looking world with large regions BUT local variety!

**Try this:**
- Walk through a plains area
- You'll occasionally find small pockets of forest or desert
- Just like in real life!

### Smarter Biome Transitions

**Ocean to Land:** Sharp coastlines (radius 1)
**Land to Land:** Smooth transitions (radius 2)

**What this means:**
- Clear beaches and shorelines
- No weird water-land mixing
- Smooth blending between forest and plains

## Finding the New Biomes

### 🎯 Quick Biome Guide

**Want Desert?**
- Temperature: Hot (0.3 to 0.7)
- Humidity: Dry (0.2 to 0.5)
- **Now 6x easier to find!**

**Want Savanna?**
- Temperature: Warm (0.5 to 0.8)
- Humidity: Medium-dry (0.2 to 0.5)
- Look for sandy areas with rare grass patches

**Want Taiga?**
- Temperature: Cold (-0.4 to 0.0)
- Humidity: High (0.4 to 0.8)
- Look for cold forested hills

**Want Tundra?**
- Temperature: Freezing (< -0.5)
- Humidity: Medium (0.2 to 0.6)
- Look for flat rocky areas

**Want Mountains?**
- Temperature: Cold (< -0.3)
- Humidity: Medium to high
- Look UP - you can't miss them now!

## The Savanna Acacia Trees

### What Makes Them Special?

**Normal trees:** Straight trunk, round canopy

**Acacia trees:** CURVED trunk, FLAT canopy!

### How They're Different

**Trunk:**
- 6 blocks tall
- Grows diagonally (curves to one side)
- 4 possible curve directions:
  - Curves north
  - Curves south
  - Curves east
  - Curves west

**Canopy:**
- Flat umbrella shape (5x5 on top)
- 3 layers of leaves:
  - Bottom layer: Hanging edges (umbrella effect)
  - Middle layer: Full flat circle
  - Top layer: Small dome (3x3)

**Looks just like real African acacia trees!**

### Where They Spawn

**Not everywhere in Savanna!**

- Savanna is 80% sand, 20% grass
- Acacias ONLY grow on grass patches
- ~3% chance on grass = 0.6% of total biome
- Creates realistic sparse distribution

**Try this:**
- Find a savanna biome
- Look for green grass patches
- Check for curved trees with flat tops

## What About Old Worlds?

### Important Information

**⚠️ Old saves will NOT have new biomes**

**Why?**
- Biome generation is determined at world creation
- Existing chunks already generated
- New algorithm only applies to NEW worlds

**What to do:**
- Create a new world to experience changes
- Your old worlds still work perfectly
- No data loss or corruption

### Starting Fresh

**Best way to experience 0.15.0:**
1. Create a brand new world
2. Fly around (F key for flight mode)
3. Explore all 8 biomes
4. Marvel at the diversity!

## Performance

**Good news:** No FPS impact!

**What was optimized:**
- Biome blending radius reduced (3 → 2)
- Ocean transitions even faster (radius 1)
- Memory usage: minimal increase

**Result:** Same smooth 60 FPS, way more variety!

## Pro Tips for Explorers

### 🗺️ Navigation Tips

**Mountains as landmarks:**
- Now visible from VERY far away
- Use them to orient yourself
- Perfect for finding your way home

**Coastlines as boundaries:**
- Sharp ocean-land transitions
- Easy to follow coastlines
- Great for exploration routes

### 🏗️ Building Tips

**Desert:** Great visibility, lots of sand for glass

**Plains:** Still best for large flat builds

**Forest:** Rolling hills = natural architecture

**Mountains:** Challenge builds, amazing views

**Savanna:** Open terrain, unique aesthetic with acacias

**Taiga:** Mountain bases with natural defenses

**Tundra:** Hardcore survival challenge

### 🌲 Tree Collecting

**Need specific wood?**
- Oak: Forest, Plains, Mountains
- Acacia: Savanna (only on grass patches!)

**Pro tip:** Mark acacia locations - they're rare and unique!

## What's Not Quite Done Yet

### Known Limitations

**Trees:** All biomes still use oak trees (except Savanna)
- Taiga should have spruce (coming soon!)
- Different tree types per biome (planned)

**Grass color:** Same green everywhere
- Biome-specific tinting (planned)
- Desert grass should be yellow-ish

**Mountain snow:** No snow on peaks yet
- Should appear above 100 blocks (planned)

**Ocean:** Still pretty empty underwater
- Underwater biomes (planned)
- Coral reefs, trenches, etc.

## Fun Challenges

### 🎮 Exploration Challenges

**The 8 Biome Challenge:**
- Can you find all 8 biomes?
- Take a screenshot in each one
- Build a small marker in each

**The Mountain Climber:**
- Find the tallest mountain in your world
- Climb to the very top
- Build a flag or beacon

**The Acacia Hunter:**

- Return to spawn
- Time yourself!

## The Bottom Line

### What Makes 0.15.0 Special?

✅ **World is 3-4x more diverse**  
✅ **8 unique biomes** (was 5)  
✅ **Deserts 6x more common**  
✅ **Mountains 2x taller**  
✅ **Every biome visually unique**  
✅ **Realistic acacia trees**

### Should You Start a New World?

**YES!** Old worlds won't have:
- New biomes (Taiga, Savanna, Tundra)
- Taller mountains
- Better desert distribution
- Acacia trees

**Start fresh and explore!** 🌍

**Have fun exploring the vastly improved world!** 🎮
