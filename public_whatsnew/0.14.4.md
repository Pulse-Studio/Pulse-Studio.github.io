# What's New in Version 0.14.4

**Welcome back!** This is a critical hotfix that finally fixes tree foliage at chunk boundaries.

## Trees Are Now Perfect!

Remember those trees with missing leaves at chunk edges? **They're gone!**

**What was fixed:**
- Trees now have complete, full foliage everywhere
- No more cut-off leaves at chunk boundaries
- Works no matter which chunks load first

**Where to see the difference:**
- Look at any forest near chunk boundaries (X or Z coordinates divisible by 16)
- Trees now look natural and complete
- Every tree has its full canopy

## Performance

- Game runs even smoother now (removed debug logging)
- Memory usage improved
- No impact on FPS

## That's It!

Short update, big impact. Enjoy your beautiful forests! ðŸŒ³
