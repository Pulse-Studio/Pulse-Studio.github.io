# What's New in Version 0.16.0

**Welcome, Player!** This update brings the game world to life with a complete sound system!

## The Game Finally Has Sound!

After months of silent gameplay, the world now responds to your actions with immersive audio!

**What you'll hear:**
- Every block interaction has unique sounds
- Footsteps that change based on surface type
- Beautiful main menu music
- Realistic 3D positional audio

## Block Sounds - Feel Every Action

### Mining Sounds (The Most Important!)

**Before:** Complete silence while mining. Boring!

**Now:** You hear distinct sounds every 250ms while breaking a block!

**How it works:**
- Click and hold to mine a block
- Hear rhythmic sounds as you work
- Each material has its own sound
- 4 different sound variations keep it interesting

**Try mining different materials:**
- **Stone** - Heavy, solid crunch sounds
- **Wood** - Lighter, woody chopping sounds
- **Sand** - Soft, sandy rustling
- **Grass** - Earthy digging sounds
- **Gravel** - Rough, rocky grinding
- **Glass** - Sharp, crystalline breaking

### Breaking Sounds (The Satisfying Moment!)

When you finally break through a block, you hear a satisfying destruction sound. It's the reward for your hard work!

### Placing Sounds (Build with Feedback!)

Every time you place a block, you get audio confirmation. No more wondering "did I place that block or not?"

## Footsteps - Your Movement Has Weight

### Different Surfaces, Different Sounds

Walk around and listen to the ground beneath your feet!

**What you'll hear:**
- **Grass** - Soft, muffled footsteps
- **Stone** - Hard, echoing steps
- **Wood** - Hollow, creaky sounds
- **Sand** - Soft, rustling steps
- **Gravel** - Crunchy, rough sounds
- **Glass** - Clear, tapping sounds

**How it works:**
- Game automatically detects block type under your feet
- Sounds play every 400ms while moving
- 6 variations per material for natural variety
- Works while walking, running, or sprinting

**Pro tip:** You can identify underground caves by the sound of your footsteps changing!

## Menu Music - Atmospheric Ambiance

### The Main Theme

Remember starting Minecraft and hearing that iconic music? Now we have our own!

**What happens:**
- Music starts when you open the game
- Continues playing as you browse menus
- Stops when you start playing (so it doesn't distract)
- Plays once per session (not annoying!)

**Where you'll hear it:**
- Main menu
- World selection screen
- Create world screen

**Fun fact:** The music file is 3 minutes of atmospheric goodness!

## 3D Positional Audio - Sound Has Direction!

### What Is 3D Audio?

Sounds now come from the correct direction! Break a block to your left? You'll hear it on the left. Behind you? You'll hear it behind you!

**Technology used:**
- HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) - the same tech used in VR games
- Distance-based volume (far away = quieter)
- Proper stereo panning (left/right positioning)

**Try this:**
- Find a friend (or imagine one!)
- Have them break blocks around you
- Close your eyes and point to where the sound is coming from
- You'll be amazed how accurate it is!

### Why This Matters

**Survival benefits:**
- Hear where danger is coming from
- Locate resources by sound
- Know if someone is sneaking up on you

**Immersion benefits:**
- Feels like you're really in the world
- More atmospheric and realistic
- Makes exploration more engaging

## Sound Categories (Coming Soon to Settings)

The foundation is ready! In the next update, you'll be able to control:

- **Master Volume** - Overall game loudness

- **Blocks** - Mining, building sounds
- **Entities** - Creature sounds (when they're added!)
- **Weather** - Rain, thunder (when weather is added!)

**Right now:** All sounds play at preset volumes that sound great!

## Performance
