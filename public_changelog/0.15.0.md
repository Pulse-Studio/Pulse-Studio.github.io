# Version 0.15.0

**Release Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Type:** Major Feature Update

## Added

- Three new biomes: Taiga, Savanna, and Tundra
- Savanna-specific acacia trees with curved trunks and flat umbrella-shaped canopy
- Multi-scale noise system for climate generation (macro + micro scales)
- Biome-specific tree generation system
- Improved biome climate diagram with 8 total biomes

## Improved

- Biome distribution now 3-4x more diverse
- Desert frequency increased from 2% to 12% (6x more common!)
- Mountains are now twice as tall with heightModifier 4.0 and baseHeight 30
- Ocean coverage reduced from 35% to 12%
- Plains coverage reduced from 40% to 25%
- Height variation between biomes increased from 27 blocks to 140 blocks (5x more dramatic!)
- All existing biomes have enhanced parameters for better visual distinction
- Biome blending optimized with different radii for Ocean-Land (1) and Land-Land (2)

## Fixed

- Critical: Tree foliage now generates correctly at chunk boundaries after biome height changes
- Cross-chunk block queueing now uses correct coordinate order (X, Y, Z)
- Trees in Savanna biome only generate on grass patches (20% of terrain)

## Technical Details

### New Biomes

**Taiga:**
- Temperature: -0.4 to 0.0, Humidity: 0.4 to 0.8
- Cold mountain forests
- heightModifier: 1.5, baseHeight: 5
- Elevation: 70-110 blocks

**Savanna:**
- Temperature: 0.5 to 0.8, Humidity: 0.2 to 0.5
- Warm dry plains with acacia trees
- heightModifier: 0.7, baseHeight: 2
- 80% sand surface, 20% grass patches
- Unique curved acacia trees with flat canopy
- Trees only spawn on grass patches (~0.6% of biome)

**Tundra:**
- Temperature: < -0.5, Humidity: 0.2 to 0.6
- Frozen rocky plains
- heightModifier: 0.5, baseHeight: -5
- Elevation: 55-70 blocks

### Enhanced Existing Biomes

| Biome      | heightModifier | baseHeight | Change              |
|------------|----------------|------------|---------------------|
| Plains     | 0.8 → 1.0      | 0          | More varied terrain |
| Desert     | 0.6 → 0.7      | 2 → 5      | Taller dunes        |
| Forest     | 1.0 → 1.3      | 1 → 3      | Rolling hills       |
| Mountains  | 2.5 → 4.0      | 15 → 30    | 2x taller peaks!    |
| Ocean      | 0.3 → 0.2      | -12 → -20  | Deeper waters       |

### Climate System

- Macro-scale noise (0.002/0.0025) for large climate zones
- Micro-scale noise (0.01/0.012) for local variations
- Combined: 70% macro + 30% micro for realistic distribution
- Deterministic generation using coordinate-based seeds

### Tree Generation Fix

- Fixed `queueCrossChunkBlock()` parameter order
- Added debug logging for tree generation (DEV mode only)
- Retroactive application system for cross-chunk blocks
- Savanna trees validated to only spawn on grass blocks

## Performance

- FPS: No impact (stable at ~60)
- Biome blending: reduced check radius from 3 to 2
- Ocean-Land transitions: optimized to radius 1
- Memory: Minimal increase for new biome data

## Biome Distribution

**Before:**
- Ocean: 35%
- Plains: 40%
- Forest: 15%
- Mountains: 8%
- Desert: 2%

**After:**
- Plains: 25%
- Forest: 18%
- Mountains: 15%
- Ocean: 12%
- Desert: 12%
- Savanna: 10%
- Taiga: 6%
- Tundra: 2%

## Known Issues

- Trees not yet adapted to new biomes (all use oak trees except Savanna)
- Grass color doesn't change between biomes
- No snow on mountain peaks above 100 blocks
- Ocean biome lacks underwater terrain variation

## Notes

- **Important:** Old worlds will not have new biomes - create a new world to experience changes
- Debug logging available in DEV mode (F3 key)
- All biome parameters are deterministic and save-compatible
- Savanna acacia trees have 4 possible trunk curve directions
